Her skin is white
And I'm light as the sun
So holy light shines
On the things you have done
So I asked him how he became this man
How did he learn to hold fruit in his hands?
And where is the lamb that gave you your name?
He had to leave, though I begged him to stay
Left me alone when I needed the light
Fell to my knees and I wept for my life
If he had've stayed, you might understand
If he had've stayed, you never would have taken my hand
